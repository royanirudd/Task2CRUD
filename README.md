Script:
I'll demonstrate a contact manager application I've built using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and Pug templating.

I chose this stack for several reasons:

1. MongoDB offers flexible, scalable data storage, perfect for future growth.
2. Node.js and Express provide a lightweight, customizable backend.
3. Pug templating is efficient for this simple task, avoiding the overhead of larger frameworks.

During development, I faced a few challenges:

1. Implementing an edit mode required backend checks to differentiate between viewing and editing contacts.
2. Ensuring email uniqueness in the database while providing user-friendly error messages.
3. Designing a responsive layout that works well on both mobile and desktop screens.
